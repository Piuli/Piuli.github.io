  <!--
  <p>I am looking for the opportunity to gain hands on experience. I am familiar with Python, HTML, <br> CSS, JavaScript, Java, C, and bash scripting, but I am still learning.</p>
  <p>I also have a B.S. in Biochemistry. I conducted research under the supervision of Dr. Michael Groves at California State University, Fullerton. <br> We used GPAW software (python based) and Linux command line tools to map the decomposition route of a molecule named ethylamine.
    <br> I also published a paper to the university's journal, <a href="src/Images/Dimensions2018_web.pdf#page=75" target="_blank"> DIMENSIONS 2018.</a></p>
  -->
  <p> I work with Dr. Maleknaz Nayebi in the EXINES lab. <p>
